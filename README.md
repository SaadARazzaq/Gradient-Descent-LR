# House Price Prediction Analysis 🏠💰

## Overview ℹ️:
This repository contains Python code to analyze and predict house prices using linear regression. It includes preprocessing steps, gradient descent implementation, closed-form solution computation, visualization, and comparison of results.

## Instructions 🛠️:
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Ensure the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.
3. Upload the `DataX.dat` and `DataY.dat` files to your Colab environment.
4. Execute the code cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize the results.

## Code Snippet 📄:

## Conclusion 📝:
- Gradient Descent: Provides parameter values suitable for interpretation, with reasonable magnitudes indicating the impact of features on house prices.
- Closed-form Solution: May encounter numerical instability issues, leading to extremely large parameter values, making interpretation challenging.

## Note 📌:
- Ensure proper preprocessing and feature scaling to enhance model performance and stability.
- Experiment with different learning rates and iterations for gradient descent optimization.
- Visualize data and results to gain insights into the relationships between features and house prices.
