# House Price Prediction Analysis 🏠💰

## Overview ℹ️:
This repository contains Python code to analyze and predict house prices using linear regression. It includes preprocessing steps, gradient descent implementation, closed-form solution computation, visualization, and comparison of results.

## Instructions 🛠️:
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Ensure the required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) are installed.
3. Upload the `DataX.dat` and `DataY.dat` files to your Colab environment.
4. Execute the code cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize the results.

## Code Snippet 📄:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Read data files
X = pd.read_csv('DataX.dat', sep='\s+', header=None)
Y = pd.read_csv('DataY.dat', sep='\s+', header=None)

# Preprocessing
# Add a column of ones to X
X[3] = 1
X = X[[3, 0, 1, 2]]  # Rearrange columns
X.columns = ['x_0', 'x_1', 'x_2', 'x_3']  # Rename columns
Y.columns = ['y_0']

# Convert to numpy arrays
X_train = X.values
Y_train = Y.values

# Feature scaling
# Normalize features
for i in range(1, 4):
    mean = np.mean(X_train[:, i])
    std = np.std(X_train[:, i])
    X_train[:, i] = (X_train[:, i] - mean) / std

# Implement Gradient Descent or Closed-form solution
# Training the model using Gradient Descent
def training_model(X, y, alpha, total_iterations):
    # Implementation details...
    pass

iterations = 60000
theta, costs = training_model(X_train, Y_train, 0.02, iterations)

# Closed-form solution
theta_norm = np.dot(np.linalg.pinv(np.dot(X_train.T, X_train)), np.dot(X_train.T, Y_train))

# Visualization and Comparison
# Plotting cost vs. iterations
plt.plot(np.arange(iterations), costs)
plt.xlabel('Iterations')
plt.ylabel('Costs')
plt.show()

# Visualizing data or comparison of results
# Implementation details...

```

## Conclusion 📝:
- Gradient Descent: Provides parameter values suitable for interpretation, with reasonable magnitudes indicating the impact of features on house prices.
- Closed-form Solution: May encounter numerical instability issues, leading to extremely large parameter values, making interpretation challenging.

## Note 📌:
- Ensure proper preprocessing and feature scaling to enhance model performance and stability.
- Experiment with different learning rates and iterations for gradient descent optimization.
- Visualize data and results to gain insights into the relationships between features and house prices.
